You should now have a folder 'C:\\OSGeo4W\\apache\\htdocs\\lizmap\\lizmap-web-client-2.10.3\\'

19. Test Lizmap Web Client Installation


Test if LizMap Web Client is well installed by opening in the browser the link: http://localhost/lizmap/lizmap-web-client-2.10.3/lizmap/www. You should see displayed the project "Montpellier" supplied with LizMap Web Client and set to be visible to all. To view maps, it is necessary to configure LizMap Web Client.

20. Administration Interface

Go to the address http://localhost/lizmap/lizmap-web-client-2.10.3/lizmap/www/admin.php and connect with the login / password: 'admin/admin'.

23. Check

To ensure that the configuration was successful, click on 'Project List' above. You should have access to two maps since you are authenticated as administrator. Click on one of the maps. If the configuration is good you should view the map, and thus be in possession of a Lizmap Web Client ready for yours.


Add Spatialite support to PHP
==============================================================

To use the editing tool on Spatialite layers, it is necessary to add the spatialite extension to PHP. Unfortunately, it requires a PHP version of at least 5.3 to do it, and for now, the installer OSGeo4W offers only 5.2.

*It is therefore not possible at this time under Windows with the apache server from the OSGeo4W installer to use Spatialite layers for editing.*

Lizmap Web Client tests whether the Spatialite support is enabled in PHP. If it is not, then the Spatialite layers will not be used in the editing tool. You can always use PostgreSQL data instead.
