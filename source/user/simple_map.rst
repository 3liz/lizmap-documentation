A simple map
============

Lizmap offers default web maps with the following features:

* pan
* zoom on area drawn by the user
* zoom more
* selecting a zoom level with a scale bar
* zoom less
* scale display as a scale bar and numerically

The order and organization of layers in the layers panel management meet those defined in the QGIS by the map publisher.

   :align: center
   :scale: 80%

Zooming and paning are available on the right of the map. To zoom on an area, you need to select the *zoom by rectangle* and drag to draw a rectangle defining the area to reach.

You can using the *triangle*, left the layers title, bring up the legend of the layer.

Selection boxes allow you to hide and display the proposed layers.

Themes allow you to change layers visibility following a context.

To take full advantage of the map, you can hide the panel management layers.

Finally you can:
