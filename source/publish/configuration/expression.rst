QGIS Expression
===============

As in QGIS Desktop, Lizmap can use `QGIS expression <https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html>`_ .

Advanced forms
--------------

For editing, it's possible to use expressions for constraints, default value, group visibility.
Read :ref:`edition-expressions`.

Layouts
-------

It's possible to use expressions in layouts, for dates, path of a Lizmap media.

In a layout, the expression ``map_credits`` or
`more complex expressions <https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/composer_items/composer_label.html#exploring-expressions-in-a-label-item>`_
are useful.
