Layer configuration
===================

These settings are in :menuselection:`Layer properties`.

.. _alias_on_fields:

Add a alias on a field
----------------------

Usually, the field names are defined without accent, spaces and can't be very long.
In :menuselection:`Layer Properties --> Attribute Forms` and clicking on a field, you can add an alias.

This will be used to substitute the field name when possible for a more friendly name.

:menuselection:`Layer Properties --> Source Fields`, you can the list of alias defined on the layer.
