Changing the default image of a project
---------------------------------------

By default the following image is displayed for a project:

.. image:: /images/mapmonde.jpg
   :align: left
   :width: 15%


You can change this default image by adding in the same project folder a .png image with the exact project name and extension. Example: If the project is called montpellier.qgs you can add an image named montpellier.qgs.png. Note that the image has the project extension too.
