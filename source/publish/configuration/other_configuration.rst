Changing the default image of a project
---------------------------------------

By default the following image is displayed for a project:

.. image:: /images/mapmonde.jpg
   :align: left
   :width: 15%


You can change this default image by adding in the same project folder a ``.png`` image with the exact project
name and extension. Example, if the project is called :file:`montpellier.qgs` you must add an image named
:file:`montpellier.qgs.png`. Note that the image has the project extension too.
