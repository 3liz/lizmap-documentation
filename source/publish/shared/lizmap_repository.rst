To understand how projects are listed **vertically** and **horizontally**, let's have a look to the
`demo website <https://demo.lizmap.com>`_.

If you look carefully, we can see there are some **Lizmap repositories** such as :

* :guilabel:`Features` containing for instance :

    * Cats : :file:`cats.qgs` and :file:`cats.qgs.cfg`
    * Landuse : :file:`landuse.qgs` and :file:`landuse.qgs.cfg`
    * Action and SQL : :file:`action.qgs` and :file:`action.qgs.cfg`
    * ...

* :guilabel:`Modules` :

    * PgMetadata
    * PgRouting

It's important to note that a **Lizmap repository** can contain one or many :file:`QGS` files.

* **QGIS projects** are displayed **horizontally** within a same folder.

* **Folders** are displayed **vertically** on the landing page.
