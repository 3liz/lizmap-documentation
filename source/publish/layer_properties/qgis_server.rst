QGIS Server
===========

Metadata
--------

In :menuselection:`Layer Properties --> QGIS Server`, you can set different settings for QGIS Server :

* :guilabel:`Short name` is a machine readable name for the layer.
* :guilabel:`dataUrl` is the URL to a HTML or PDF presenting the data. It can be a link to the open data portal webpage.

If the link is empty in :menuselection:`Lizmap --> Layers` dialog, the link in Lizmap will be automatically populated
by the Lizmap plugin from set in this tab.

You can use the |refresh_svg| button in Lizmap to pick this value.
