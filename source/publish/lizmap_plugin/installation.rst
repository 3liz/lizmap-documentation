Install and upgrade the Lizmap plugin
=====================================

The Lizmap plugin is available through the official `QGIS repository <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/server/>`_.

Install it with the QGIS plugin manager:

.. include:: ../shared/lizmap_plugin_installation.rst

.. warning::
    Lizmap QGIS plugin is regularly updated. To enjoy new features or before reporting a bug, be sure to update your plugin.
    In :menuselection:`Menu --> Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins --> Settings`, check that QGIS will check for
    updates on a regular basis automatically.

    And then, you must do the upgrade yourself when QGIS is noticing you. You should visit the plugin manager from
    time to time.

.. tip::
    Do not install the plugin called ``Lizmap server`` on your QGIS desktop. It's only used on a server.
