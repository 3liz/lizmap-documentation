Iframe
======

Principle
---------

It's possible to embed Lizmap in another webpage by using a iframe. We suggest you to change the view ``map`` by
``embed`` in the URL to have lighter version of the interface.

For instance, use this URL : ``/index.php/view/embed/?repository=my_repo&project=my_project``.

Example
-------

You can visit both links to see the difference :

* https://demo.lizmap.com/lizmap/index.php/view/map/?repository=demo&project=lampadaires
* https://demo.lizmap.com/lizmap/index.php/view/embed/?repository=demo&project=lampadaires
