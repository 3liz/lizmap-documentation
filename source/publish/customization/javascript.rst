Adding your own JavaScript
==========================

.. contents::
   :depth: 3

Principle
---------

Adding some JavaScript (JS) is useful for a variety of advanced usage.
For instance, you can:

    - hide some UI elements that you don't want to display by default
    - add a custom button in the UI
    - add a popup when the project is opened (to display funders, creditsâ€¦)
    - avoid people being able to download elements of the page by right clicking on them, and of course much more.

Prerequisites
-------------

* This function needs to be activated by the administrator of the Lizmap instance.
* The :file:`media` directory. Read how to use :ref:`media` folder in Lizmap.

Configuring the tool
--------------------

* In your repository (e.g. :file:`/home/data/repo1/myproject.qgs`), you should have these directories::

    media
    |-- js
      |-- myproject
      |-- default

* All the JavaScript code you copy in the :file:`/home/data/rep1/media/js/myproject/` directory will be executed by Lizmap for this **specific** project only.
* All the JavaScript code in ``default`` will be executed for **all** projects.
* To allow the execution of JavaScript code, in the Lizmap admin interface, you **must** add the privilege :guilabel:`Allow themes for this repository`.

Video tutorial
--------------

This video is an quick start how to add a JavaScript to change the default panel in Lizmap.

Library of scripts
------------------

You can find some examples in the repository https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-javascript-scripts.

Also, in the directory :file:`lizmap-web-client/lizmap/install/qgis/media/js/` (or in GitHub https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/tree/master/extra-modules/lizmapdemo/qgis-projects/demoqgis/media/js/montpellier), you can find examples of suitable JavaScript code.

Remove the extension ``.example`` and copy them to your :file:`media/js/default/` folder to activate them.

Available Javascript events
---------------------------

The Javascript code can use many events fired by Lizmap Web Client. Here is a list of all the events available, with the returned properties.

.. csv-table:: Lizmap Web Client available events

There are also some variables which are available.

.. csv-table:: Lizmap Web Client available variables
   :header: "Variable name", "Description"

   "lizUrls.media","URL to get a media"
   "lizUrls.params.repository","Name of the current repository"
   "lizUrls.params.project","Name of the current project"

Examples
--------

Collapse a group in the legend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

    lizMap.events.on({
        uicreated: function(e) {
            $('#group-groupname td a.expander').click();
        }
    });

Disable right click
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a file named e.g. :file:`disableRightClick.js` with the following code:

.. code-block:: javascript

   lizMap.events.on({
      uicreated: function(e) {
         $('body').attr('oncontextmenu', 'return false;');
      }
   });

* If you want this code to be executed for all projects of your repository, you have to copy the file in the directory :file:`/home/data/rep1/media/js/default/` rather than in :file:`/home/data/rep1/media/js/myproject/`.

Send current login user-ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example allowing you to send current login User-ID (and/or other user data) to PostgreSQL table column, using edition tool:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var formPrefix = 'jforms_view_edition';

   // Name of the QGIS vector layer fields which must contain the user info
   // In the list below, replace the right side by your own fields in Lizmap
   var userFields = {
      login: 'your_lizmap_user_login_field',
      firstname: 'your_lizmap_user_firstname_field',
      lastname: 'your_lizmap_user_lastname_field',
      organization: 'your_lizmap_user_organization_field'
   };


   lizMap.events.on({

      'lizmapeditionformdisplayed': function(e){

         // If user is logged in
         if( $('#info-user-login').length ){
               // Loop through the needed fields
               for( var f in userFields ){
                  // If the user has some data for this property
                  if( $('#info-user-' + f).text() ){
                     // If the field exists in the form
                     var fi = $('#' + formPrefix + '_' + userFields[f]);
                     if( fi.length ){
                           // Set val from lizmap user data
                           fi.val( $('#info-user-' + f).text() )
                           // Set disabled
                           fi.hide();
                     }
                  }
               }
         }

      }

   });


URL of a static file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to get the URL of a static file, located in the :ref:`media` folder:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var mediaUrl = OpenLayers.Util.urlAppend(
        lizUrls.media,
        OpenLayers.Util.getParameterString({
            "repository": lizUrls.params.repository,
            "project": lizUrls.params.project,
            "path": "picture.png"
        })
   );

or

.. code-block:: javascript

    var domain = 'https://' + document.domain + lizUrls.basepath;
    var image  = '<img src="' + domain + 'index.php/view/media/getMedia?repository=REPOSITORY&project=PROJECT&path=/media/logo.png" title="Logo" />';
