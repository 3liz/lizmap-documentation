Lizmap - Images for documentation
=================================
This directory contains at its root images for every languages. If you want to translate images for your language create a directory (e.g. fr) and put images with the same name than original in it.

Only add progressive jpg images (better for web). You can convert png to jpg with this imagemagick's command: `convert -strip -interlace plane -quality 80`.
